### The optimization of rendering user's video avatar

#### background
In the process of updating our product, we included a feature related to audio/video that allows user's video avatar to follow the movement of the mouse and also supports limiting the scaling of the avatar. However, in the initial version, we encountered some issues with the avatars drifting off target and lagging, as outlined below:
![alt text](imgs/avatarFollowing.gif)

#### Analysis of the issue:

1. Tasks on the main thread were all marked as `long tasks`, highlighted with a red tag;
![alt text](imgs/longTask.png)
2. Upon examining the activities on the main thread in the performance panel, we found that during these long tasks, the `Event:mousemove` accounted for 76.4% of the time. Within this time, `dispatchUserBlockingUpdate` took up 58.4% of the time. As shown below:
 ![alt text](imgs/mouseMoveEvent.png)
 ![alt text](imgs/mouseMoveEvent1.png)

The reasons for this excessive time consumption could be due to frequent and substantial updates or prolonged computations.

3. Looking over the memory usage. It soars.

4. I opened the React Profiler and recorded the activity of other's mouse movement. I noticed that just moving the mouse caused many unrelated components to update, as shown below:
![alt text](imgs/affectOtherComps.png)

The reasons for this are as follows: 
a. The data for the mouse trails, called userCursorMap, is stored in the RecordSpace store, which also holds many other space-related data items. 
```
interface RecordState {
    a: string
    b: boolean
    .....
    userCursorMap:{
        [id:string]:{x:number,y:number}
        }
}
```

b. When other modules use this store, they reference it incorrectly, leading to updates in any data within RecordSpace would affect all components that depend on it.

***Bad Example*** 

```
const CompA = ()=>{
   const {a} = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace);
}
const CompB = ()=>{
   const {b} = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace);
}
const UserCursor =()=>{
   const {userCursorMap} = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace);
}
```
***Good Example***
```
const CompA = ()=>{
   const a = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace.a);
}
const CompB = ()=>{
   const b = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace.b);
}
const UserCursor =()=>{
   const userCursorMap = useAppSelector((state)=> state.recordSpace.userCursorMap);
}
```

### solutions

#### #1 Using rAF to debounce
In the lifecycle of a frame, rAF sits between the `begin frame` and the `layout` phase. This allows us to handle some calculations, syncing each frame of an animation with the screen's refresh rate to speed up the process and reduce lag.

```
const useUserCursor = ()=> {
  const [x,setX] = useState<number>();
  const [y,setY] = useState<number>();
  const mouse = useMouse();

  const renderAnimation = () => {
    requestAnimationFrame(()=>{
        const {oX,oY} = getAbosulteByRelateXY(mouse.clinetX,mouse.clientY);
    });
    setX(oX);
    setY(oY);
  };

  useEffec(()=>{
    renderAnimation();
  },[mouse])
}
```


#### #2 usSelector optimization
As shown above in the bad and good examples.


After optimization, 
1. the average task time on the main thread has dropped from 84ms to 14ms, and the event time for 'pointermove' has also decreased to 4.3ms.

2. The memory usage on the page has returned to a normal fluctuation.

3. The updates to the mouse component from others now solely depend on the movement of their mouse.

and finally, we have gotten this:

It lookes much smoother.


However, the story has not yet come to an end. Let us explore a little bit more:

#### #3 forcus on the browser rendering process
At the same time, we noticed a high frequency of layout shifts shown on the performance panel. When we checked the `Frames` section, it became clear that a layout reflow occurred every 16.7ms (each frame). This issue stems from our use of the `requestAnimationFrame (rAF)`, which schedules the changes within a frame's cycle. During this cycle, after obtaining the x and y coordinates, we directly altered the element's position using `'position'`, which caused the layout shifts, as shown in the diagram below. This approach is costly because every change in style that moves the position triggers updates across the entire rendering pipelineâ€”from `layout` to `layer`, then `paint`, and finally to `composition`. This results in significant overhead.
![alt text](imgs/layoutshift.png)
![alt text](imgs/reflow.png)

By switching from using `'position'` to `'transform'`, we can bypass the `layout` and `paint` stages, allowing the animation to run on a non-main thread. This approach is highly efficient because it offloads the work to a secondary thread, freeing up the main thread's resources and skipping the layout and painting phases.
```
// change postion to transform

// positon:
style = {{position: 'fixed',left: x + "px" , top: y + "px" }}

// trasform
style ={{transform:`translate(${x}px,${y}px)`}}
```

After optimizing, there's no longer any dense layout shifting. In each task, the re-layout process is skipped, and all changes occur on the compositing thread. This makes the animation smoother and more resource-efficient.

#### #4 using API for help
To optimize frequent operations like moving and scaling avatars, we use the `transform` property. Another advantage of handling animations directly in the compose thread is that we can use the `will-change` property. This tells the rendering engine in advance that we plan to apply special effects transformations to an element. The engine then processes these transformations on a separate layer, which are handled directly by the composite thread without involving the main thread. This significantly boosts rendering efficiency. 
```
// css
will-change: transform
```

Additionally, upgrading from `translate` to `translate3d` can enhance performance. `translate3d` enables GPU acceleration for 3D transformations, making it more efficient than the standard `translate`.
